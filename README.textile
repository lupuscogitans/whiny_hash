h1. AngryHash

AngryHash is a pretty minimalistic gem that offers a slightly tweaked Hash functionality which is primarily intended for the passing of optional parameters. The behavior differs from normal hashes in the following points:

* reading unset keys results in an error instead of nil
* setting previously unset keys results in an error
* merging previously unset keys results in an error

This doesn't sound like a great improvement, but it simplifies coding quite a lot:

<pre>
  DEFAULTS = AngryHash({class: "default_class", id: "default_id", value: 0})
  
  def foo(opts={})
    options = DEFAULTS.merge(opts)
    # ...do things...
    options[:bar] # raises an error
  end
  
  foo class: 'my_class', value: 23 # fine
  foo clas: 'my_class', value: 23 # raises an error
</pre>

So you quickly discover

* usage of undefined options
* overriding of undefined options

Since we firmly believe in 'indifferent access', AngryHash is derived from ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess which is part of <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activesupport" target="_blank">activesupport</a>.
